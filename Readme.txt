Excel to Dublin Core
----------------------

This small project transforms an Excel spreadsheet into Dublin core terms to be able to import them into DSpace. 
The aim is to ease batch import on organizations were metadata is stored in Excel files.

Works with Excel 2007 and DSpace 1.5.1. 

It may potentially work with newer versions of Excel and Dspace, but it has not been tested.
